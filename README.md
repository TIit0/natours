This was all about Css And Sass

## Process:

This was Focused on Learning Scss and Css all the basics and a bit more

1. Learning the Framework
 
 - Learning the basics such as nesting selectors and best practices, dos - don'ts and tons of practice 


2. learning more advanced things like Flex-box, mixins the checkbox hack.

- I ended up learning flexbox with a super fun game called Flex-box zombies. honestly it is the best way to learn in my opinion, after that I just applied all of that 
into the project. I made the nav menu with a trick called checkbox hack. 
checkboxes have active states where you can add styling if they are checked  so it acts like a button. 


3. No JS

- Here is where things got a little difficult. since I was using Css beyond it's normal scope i reached some road bumps as expected. so I had to find clever ways now to keep the checkbox hack, and still Manage to create my Media queries and responsive layout. as well as make the animations and everything pretty.

I learned a Ton with this project.
